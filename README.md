Project title: **DESIGN OF INTELLIGENT POSITION CONTROLLER USING PPO ALGORITHM**

Group members:
1. Ibrahim bin Nasrum
2. Muhammad Hafidzuddin Hanif Danial bin Norizal
3. Shareen Arawie bin Hisham
4. Muhammad Muhairis Bin Azman

**Instruction:**

1. For PID control, run 2.1 and 2.2 together in both arduino and python, respectively.
2. For PPO control, run 3.1 and 3.2 together in both arduino and python, respectively.
3. Both PPO and PID python codes are capable to interface with Node-RED using MQTT protocol.
4. PPO need to be trained first before inference.
